Procedure:

Start, open working spreadsheet
1) copy next 50 plates to plates.csv
2) enter five licence plate number in the multiple vehicle search page
3) copy the entire text response
4) paste, appending the text to response.txt
5) repeat 2,3,4  
6) parse response.txt
7) open data.csv with ms Excel and copy entire file into appropriate cells
8) repeat from 1 until all plates are finished
Finish, copy and paste 'values only' from cells with name, addr, and ownership 


Primary breakdown of work:

         plates in .xlsx format
DONE     plates in .csv format
DONE     input from  infile.csv
working  query web page
working  fill form
working  scrape results
working  parse 
DONE     write to outfile.csv
         write to outfile.xlsx
         integrate parsed information with original spreadsheet, assert plates match


Secondary issues:
         multiple plate responses - same or different owner - start date , end date ?
working  how to handle text with \n in it ? 
 working  BROK\n EN(.|,) - word ending in ',' or '.' with newline embedded
 working  750\n 10-1111  -ZipPlus with newline embedded
          750\n 10       - 5 digit zip code with newline embedded
 unknown  addline with \n 
         choose earlies date, issued or reg dt ?
         assert dates are not in the future
         assert key-in is the same as key-out
         alpha-numerics only. #nnn should be assigned address2 without #
         does placard work ? should return no record
         optimize findStartEnd()
DONE     move re.compile()'s out of loops, where possible
DONE     fill in parsePermit()


Notes:
	plates with white space in record?
	do special plates, ie dealer have special lookup ? I.E. master record
	are there keywords or symbols for use in pattern matching?

	RTS database - Registration Title System database of all? records since 1998.

	cookies and authentication?
