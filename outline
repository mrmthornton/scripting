it's mechanical, 
can be automated
pushbutton
email not snailmail
person looks at questionable items/ decides
database - entry very routine
Texpress extractions - routine
produce statistics

I will stay until NTTA/Legal is satisfied then move on to next project.

I have experience prototyping tools which help make decisions clearer.
