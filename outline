it's mechanical, 
can be automated
pushbutton
email not snailmail
person looks at questionable items/ decides
database - entry very routine
Texpress extractions - routine
produce statistics

processesing overnight for routine cases

use SQL , not RITE. using RITE is a stopgap measure.

there are temporary tools.  until a commercial solution is implemented 

I will stay until NTTA/Legal is satisfied then move on to next project.

I have experience prototyping tools which help make decisions clearer.

we have vendors looking into this:

we expect to streamline the process with vendors handling mail and returning a list of name and address history and case numbers?

Bankruptcy processing involves many well understood steps, which require little human intervention, one the catagory of processing has been identified. 

Many of these steps, or subprocesses, can be automated, and is actually advantageous since the automation reduces handling time and eliminates human error.

The ultimate goal would be to have " routine" cases processed with a the click of button.
(or not even click of a button)

The EBN(electronic bankruptcy notficatons service) encourages the use of non-physical information transfer.  Specifically, the XML data exchange format is a mature, robust and widely used means of communication for parties receiving notifications.

The use of this techonology allows an email with a link, to replace a physical letter.  It also allows the recipient to automate (efficient) storage of all documents, with a historical record.

There will always be a need to a person, knowledgeable of bankruptcy, to examine cases which are non-routine.

A decision maker will be freed up to carefully examine and research unusuall or novel cases, and make a decision.

Our current database entries are fact based and only need human input for the comment field. ( which departments, positions use the database?)

The Texpress issue, currently unresolve, would be automated.

Generation of statistics would become trivial.

Routine cases would be processed overnight.

These tools, and in particular the user of RITE as an API, are a stopgap measure, inteded to last only until a commercial grade replacement is in place. 

This level of automation can be implemented using the existing RITE system, however, SQL queries using read only access to the varous databases would increase efficiency and accuracey.  The posible databases are vps, tagstore, zipcash, dmv, txdot, usps and vendor name/address history.
