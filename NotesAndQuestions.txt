Primary breakdown of work:

DONE     save excel to csv
DONE     input from  infile.csv
         query web page
         fill form
         scrape results
working  parse 
DONE     write to outfile.csv
         save to excel current format


Secondary issues:
         how to handle text with cr lf in the middle ?
         choose earlies date, issued or reg dt ?
         assert dates are not in the future
         assert key-in is the same as key-out
         RTS database
         alpha-numerics only. #nnn should be assigned address2 without #
         does placard work ?
         optimize findStartEnd()
DONE     move re.compile()'s out of loops
         fill in parsePermit()
